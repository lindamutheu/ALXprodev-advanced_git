# Feature Branch: implement-login

## Objective

## Instructions Followed

1. Created a new feature branch named `feature/implement-login` from the `develop` branch using GitFlow.
2. In the feature branch, created a directory called `login-page`.
3. Inside `login-page`, added a `README.md` file with the message:  
   > Login Feature Coming soon
4. Committed the changes with the message:  
   `feat: scaffolding login page`
5. Pushed the feature branch to GitHub.

## Notes
